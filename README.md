# UBC-MATH-ART_CONTEST

## Project Overview

The UBC-MATH-ART_CONTEST project transforms a JPEG image of the UBC Math Annex Building into a unique ASCII art representation. In this creative endeavor, the word "UBC" is used as the building's texture, with each instance of "UBC" symbolizing one of the 92,070 students, staff, and faculty across the Vancouver and Okanagan campuses. This artwork pays homage to the enriching experiences and knowledge gained at UBC.



## Purpose

This project celebrates the collective community of UBC by representing each individual through the repeated use of the UBC word in the ASCII image. It showcases the intersection of mathematics, art, and community, reflecting the vibrant and diverse learning environment at UBC.

## How It Works

1. **Image Conversion:** A JPEG image of the UBC Math Annex Building is processed and converted into an ASCII art format.
2. **Word Representation:** The ASCII image is created using the word "UBC" repeated 92,070 times, ensuring each character in the image represents a member of the UBC community.
3. **Output:** The result is a visually engaging ASCII representation of the Math Annex Building, made up entirely of the word "UBC."
