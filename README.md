# UBC MATH ART CONTEST 2024

## Project Overview

This project transforms a JPEG image of the UBC Math Annex Building into a unique ASCII art representation. In this creative endeavor, the word "UBC" is used as the building's texture, with each instance of "UBC" symbolizing one of the 92,070 students, staff, and faculty across the Vancouver and Okanagan campuses. This artwork pays homage to the enriching experiences and knowledge gained at UBC. This is my submission for the UBC Math Artwork Contest which happened between August 2nd, 2024 and August 16th, 2024



## Purpose

This project celebrates the collective community of UBC by representing each individual through the repeated use of the UBC word in the ASCII image and also captures and brings attention to one of my favourite buildings on campus. I've walked by the Math Annex Building many times throughout my undergrad and even attended a few lectures in it. My favourite one being Math 220: Introduction to Mathematical Proofs by Prof. Andrew Rechnitzer. I've also participated in a few events hosted by the Undergraduate Mathematics Society in this very building and made a few friends here too! ðŸ˜Š

## How It Works

1. **Image Conversion:** A JPEG image of the UBC Math Annex Building is processed and converted into an ASCII art format.
2. **Word Representation:** The ASCII image is created using the word "UBC" repeated exactly 92,070 times, ensuring each character in the image represents a member of the UBC community.
3. **Output:** The result is a visually engaging ASCII representation of the Math Annex Building, made up entirely of the word "UBC" in a PDF format with the given specifications of the ART contest.
